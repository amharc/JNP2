# JNP2
An interpreter of a toy functional language. Written in C# for the JNP2 course @ MIMUW

Again, this is a very simple programming language, but it supports lazy evaluation, algebraic data types, pattern matching and Hindley-Milner type inference.

Some samples can be found in the MobLang/Resources directory and in the test cases.

It also has a very basic GUI with syntax highlighting for Windows Phone (because I was required to make a user-facing app during this course :D).
